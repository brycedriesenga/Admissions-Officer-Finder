        <h3>Why did you pick Ferris?</h3>
        <p>I selected Ferris as my Alma matter because of the practical educational opportunities the 
        school provides. Ferris State University offers many innovative majors, small classes and 
        hands-on teaching. I am proud that we are focused on assisting students with their career 
        goals. Ferris State University has played an important role in my family history. My father 
        worked here for 30 years before retiring. My wife, brother, sisters, and sister-in-law have all 
        attended Ferris as students as well</p>
